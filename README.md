# ark_manager_web

## Installation:
This is an installation guide for an ubuntu based host and support for more OSes will 
be tested in the future.
### Required Software
The packages below must be installed with a sudo user:
```bash
# Required
memcached
curl
git
build-essential
autoconf 
bison 
libssl-dev 
libyaml-dev 
libreadline6-dev 
zlib1g-dev 
libncurses5-dev 
libffi-dev 
libgdbm3 
libgdbm-dev

```
The things below must be installed under a user account to prevent security
risks. It is suggested to install under the user name `steam` for consistency
sake.
```bash
# Install rbenv
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
cd ~/.rbenv && src/configure && make -C src
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Install rbenv-build
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build


# Install Ruby
cd ~
rbenv install 2.3.3 # Recommended Version as this is the version the source is based on 
rbenv shell 2.3.3 # Change the version number here if you are not using the recommended version

# Now we install bundle for ruby
gem install bundle

# Finally lets clone the repo
git clone $URL_HERE ~/ArkManagerWeb

# Setting up the repo
cd ~/ArkManagerWeb
bundle install --binstubs

# Get Ark Manager
bundle exec rake install_server_tools

# Install Ark Server
bundle exec rake install_ark_server
```
## Running the interface:
Running the interface:
```bash
cd  ~/ArkManagerWeb
bundle exec unicorn -c ./config/unicorn.rb -D
```
This will allow the interface to be visible from `127.0.0.1:8080` of the machine its set up on.
If you wish to change this edit the unicorn.rb file and change the listening field.
## Recommendations
It is recommended to set this up behind a `nginx` reverse proxy as well as enabling `ufw` to block
access to port 8080. That will prevent unwanted insecure access to the web interface. The next
suggestion would be to set up an htpasswd file with users or a seperate authentication system.

Another recommendation would be to set up supervisord to run the software for you so it will start on boot.

### Example Nginx Configuration
nginx.conf file, It is recommended to install `letsencrypt`/`cerbot` and generate a ssl for your site.
